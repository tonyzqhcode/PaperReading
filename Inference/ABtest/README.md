Abstract:
This article described a way to determine the threshold which will trigger ‘fraction’. A loss function which includes the cost of false positive, false negative, and true negative have been used. A key part of the loss function is the ‘churn’ caused by ‘fraction’, which need to be estimated by using A/B test.     
The A/B test is a imbalance A/B test and delta methods have been used to estimate the variance.

Abstract:  
Growth team want to test if a new page design can improve search engine ranking. However, search engine ranking cannot be measured directly. So, website traffic is used as a proxy.
There are several limitations for applying A/B test at user’s level. The biggest change is that the unit of randomization is not fixed, and users can get different treatment. Hence, a market-level experiment is designed, and a specific canonical URL is unit of randomization 
DID was used to identify the treatment effect.
