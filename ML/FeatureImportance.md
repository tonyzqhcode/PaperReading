## How to evaluate model feature importance for black-box ML models
- Calculate score change after removing feature
  Cons: requires re-train model, which is not effective 
 
- Replace feature with random noise and then calculate score change based on trained model

Paper provide a good overview of existing feature importance measurment methods. It also explains why correlated variable will inflate misleading results.

Paper shows CRT based RF will favor attributes with more cut-off points.

Paper evaluate variable importance by permutating dependent variable <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{150}&space;\small&space;y_{i}" title="\small y_{i}" /></a>
.P-value can also be caculated through permutation test
